# POEMIX

![Poemix logo](poemix.png)

<center><h3>ðŸ–¤ A minimalist platform to share my poetry ðŸ’£</h3></center>

The main purpose behind **Poemix** is to promote my publications in an *open and free way*, migrating from the Issuu platform, whose free version had become very limited and full of ads.

The idea was to create something simple, without fancy details or distracting animations, focusing only on displaying my fanzines and books.

I also took the opportunity to explore new tools such as Vite and TailwindCSS.
